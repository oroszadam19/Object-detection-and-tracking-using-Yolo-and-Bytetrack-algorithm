# Object-detection-and-tracking-using-Yolo-and-Bytetrack-algorithm
This project uses YOLOv8 and ByteTrack for real-time object detection and tracking. Each object is highlighted with a class-based color, showing confidence scores and tracker IDs. The system processes video frame by frame and outputs an annotated video for clear visual distinction of objects.
